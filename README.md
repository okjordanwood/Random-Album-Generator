## Overview
Album Generator is a web application that allows users to randomly select an album from a pre-defined list of albums.

+ 📅 Detailed Information: Display album genre, subgenres, release date, and a link to listen on Spotify.
+ 🔄 Caching: Implemented caching to reduce redundant API calls for faster performance.
+ ⏳ Loading Spinner: Display a loading message while data is being fetched.
