## Overview
Album Generator is a web application that allows users to randomly select an album from a pre-defined list of albums. The user can filter albums by genre, and the app fetches detailed information from Spotify, including album cover art, artist picture, genre, subgenres, release date, and a link to listen on Spotify.
